Consulting the BOE, law 14/2011, updated on 01/11/2023, article 15 (page 28) tells us about various obligations of the researcher and here I will comment on those that involve me \cite{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Avoid plagiarism and misappropriation of authorship of scientific works or third-party technologies} \\
    On this point, I have at all times cited other people's resources and whenever I have used a third-party technological resource I have made sure that it is open source and that its necessary citations are made.
