This work is a final project for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, specializing in Computing.
The project is completed at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), specifically at the Facultat d'Informàtica de Barcelona (FIB).
Gerard Escudero Bakx directs the project, with supervision from Edelmira Pasarella Sanchez.
The project builds upon the master's thesis completed by Juan Pablo Royo Sales in 2021 "An algorithm for incrementally enumerating bitriangles in large bipartite networks" \cite{juan_pablo_royo_sales_incremental_2021},supervised by Edelmira Pasarella.
Juan Pablo thesis focused on developing a Haskell library for the dynamic pipeline paradigm and its application to an algorithm for incremental enumerating bitriangles (IEBT).
This work involves understanding Juan Pablo work, including the Haskell library, its potential application to other algorithms, and the implementation of the IEBT algorithm.
The project aims to provide a guide for utilizing the library in implementing any algorithm that leverages the dynamic pipeline paradigm.
Additionally, it proposes a set of improvements to the library itself.
Furthermore, the project explores potential enhancements to the IEBT algorithm, accompanied by performance tests to validate these improvements.
