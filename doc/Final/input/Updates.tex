\section{Updates respect initial planning}
\subsection{About tasks and time planification}
\subsubsection*{Changes}
Regarding the initial planning of the project, there have not been very big changes.
The main change has been that I have needed more investment of time in understanding the library and in coding the word counting problem.
This is because I have found the need to make several adaptations to the library to allow more options and be able to implement my initial problem.
Everything and so I have only needed 2 extra week in the overall time of the \textbf{RL} and \textbf{FA} sections.

In addition to this, I have been able to specify with Edelmira what improvements I can make to the library.
This process was also planned for later, so it also changes the planning a bit.

\subsubsection*{Consequences}
All these changes in planning mean that there is less time left to perform the following tasks (SA, D3, D4).
But at the same time I have invested more time getting to know the library and programming, so I foresee that it will take me less time to improvements to the library that Edelmira proposes. 

\subsubsection*{New planning}
With this updates, the new planning is as follows:

\subsection{About scope}
\subsubsection*{Changes}
Since initially planning the scope of my work, I have had to modify it as I have progressed.
The reason is that when working with the Haskell library, I have encountered some lack of functionality at some points.
I have found that Juan Pablo made a very complete library but a little oriented to his work.
That's why when trying to implement the word counting problem, I have had to expand and create new functionalities. 

\subsubsection*{Consequences}
No several consequences have been derived from this change.
Just that I have had to invest more time in understanding the library, as reflected in the previous section.
\subsection{About budget}
\subsubsection*{Changes}
Because the scope and time planification changes, budged has also changed. 
The human resource budged needs to be recalculated tacking into account the new time planification. 
The other sections of the budget like hardware, software and unexpected const remain the same.
\subsubsection*{Consequences}
As we can apreciete in the table below, the new human resource budget is less that 0,5\% higher than the initial budget, so the changes are not significant.
